This is for my modular servers, to allow them to be nested into each other, conserving resources on my server. The modules need to be structured as stated here:

module.exports = function(app,express) {
	//express code here, using app. NO DEFINING NEW SERVERS
	//app.websocket may be used to accept websocket connections (express-ws-routes)
}

//Project-specific
